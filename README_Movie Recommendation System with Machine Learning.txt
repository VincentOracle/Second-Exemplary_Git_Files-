-Introduction
Movie Recommendation Systems are designed to assist users in discovering movies tailored to their preferences. 
This system employs machine learning algorithms to predict movie ratings based on historical user data and suggests movies that align with individual tastes.

-Features
1) Random Forest: Utilizes an ensemble of decision trees for robust predictions.
2) Support Vector Machines (SVM): Applies SVM for effective regression in predicting movie ratings.
3) Gradient Boosting: Implements a boosting algorithm for accurate rating predictions.

-User Interface: A user-friendly interface for seamless interaction and movie recommendations.
-Data Exploration: In-depth exploration of movie datasets to uncover patterns and relationships.

-Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Required Python packages (install via pip install -r requirements.txt)

-Installation
i)Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation.git
ii)Navigate to the project directory:
cd movie-recommendation
iii)Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
iv) Usage
  a) Run the main application:
     python app.py
  b) Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.

Enter movie preferences, and the system will provide personalized recommendations.

-Algorithm Details
Random Forest: Ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees.
SVM (Support Vector Machines): Effective for regression tasks, capturing complex relationships.
Gradient Boosting: Boosting algorithm emphasizing model accuracy by minimizing errors.
-Results
The system achieved competitive performance across all implemented algorithms. 
Random Forest emerged as the top performer with a model accuracy of 79.75%, closely followed by SVM (76.04%) and Gradient Boosting (75.84%).

-Future Recommendations
1.Explore ensemble approaches for enhanced predictive performance.
2. Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize algorithm performance.
3. Investigate additional features and encoding methods for richer information.
4. Implement dynamic model updating based on evolving user preferences.
